    <h2>Research Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Digitalization refers to the process of turning data into digital form. Traditional financial institutions invest in technology to automate money transfers, detect fraud and facilitate resources sharing within the firms. Managers praise technology for its benefit to firm productivity but few can inform the exact financial output associated with each dollar of input in digitalization. This research investigates how IT stock and IT environment impact value-added productivity in financial institutions from 2008 to 2018 using the three factor production functions. The result shows that IT stock in general adds value to companies. Moreover, firm productivity is more positively impacted with additional technology investment when firms are new to digitalization.
